<p>Salut! The first steps are always the most difficult ones, so people say.</p>
<p>Alors, câ€™est quoi? breaks the ice with French. By using different approaches through mnemonics, etymology, authentic photos and conversations we help you to get started with French in Montreal and Quebec.</p>
<p>No ads. No login needed. No internet required. No notifications. No in-app purchases. Available for free for early birdsâ€¦</p>

<p>Across the city you can find several meetup groups, either for free or for a small fee. No matter if you canâ€™t speak a word, or if you are fluent, you should give them a try. Or check out a local language school, a personal teacher, listen to radio or watch television.</p>

<p>The app was developed for beginners in French, who live in Montreal or Quebec. With the help of French native speakers and beginners we created a new app that teaches you words from the street â€“ not the textbook. With funny and authentic conversations we give your learning experience a more natural and regional touch.</p>

<p>We focus on Standard French. Itâ€™s well understood everywhere in Canada where people speak French. And as you go, you will learn a couple of quÃ©bÃ©cois expressions on the way.</p>

<p>No, itâ€™s not a primary learning resource. As advertised, see it as an ice breaker or additional helper if you have no or little experience in French.</p>
